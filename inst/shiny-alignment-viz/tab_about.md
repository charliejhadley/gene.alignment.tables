**Abstract:** The seroprevalence of human parvovirus-4 (PARV4) varies considerably by region, and in some settings evidence of PARV4 is strongly associated with infection with blood-borne viruses, HBV, HCV and HIV. In sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) PARV4 seroprevalence is relatively high in the general population, but little is known about the transmission routes or risk factors. To explore further the characteristics of PARV4 in this setting, with a particular focus on the prevalence and significance of coinfection, we screened individuals recruited from Durban (South Africa), Kimberley (South Africa) and Gaborone (Botswana) for PARV4 IgG and DNA, as well as documenting HIV, HBV and HCV status. Our cohorts were enriched for HIV infection (69% HIV positive). We identified no cases of HCV by PCR, but 7.4% were positive for HBsAg. PARV4 IgG was positive in 42%; seroprevalence was higher in adults (69%) compared to children (21%); p<0.0001 and in HIV-positive (52%) compared to HIV-negative individuals (24%); p<0.0001, but there was no association with HBsAg status. We identified five subjects who were PCR-positive for PARV4 genotype-3. Ex vivo CD8+ T cell responses spanned the entire PARV4 proteome and we propose a novel HLA-B*57:03-restricted epitope within the NS protein. This characterisation of PARV4 infection provides enhanced insights into the epidemiology of infection and co-infection in African cohorts, and provides the foundations for planning further focused studies to elucidate transmission pathways, immune responses, and the clinical significance of this organism.
